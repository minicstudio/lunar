# Welcome to Lunar!

We are delighted you are considering Lunar for your project. We've spent a lot of time developing this project to bring 
headless e-commerce functionality to Laravel.

## What is Lunar?

Lunar is a [Laravel e-commerce package](https://lunarphp.io/) which brings functionality akin to Shopify and other e-commerce platforms 
to Laravel. You have complete freedom to create your own storefront(s), but we've already done the hard work for you in 
the backend.

## Tech Stack

Lunar is comprised of two packages; `lunarphp/core` which provides the e-commerce functionality and `lunarphp/lunar` 
which provides an admin panel built on Filament.

:::info
Although the admin panel uses Laravel Livewire, there is no requirement for your app to use Livewire itself.

## What are the future plans?

Lunar as a company has grand plans to continue developing new functionality to help you build awesome e-commerce 
websites. We want Lunar to be a true alternative to the likes of Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.

## Get started

Enough waffle! Let's help you [install Lunar...](/core/installation)
