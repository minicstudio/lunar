## Install Lunar

### Composer Require Package

```sh
composer require lunarphp/lunar:"^1.0" -W
```

### Add the LunarUser Trait

Some parts of the core rely on the User model having certain relationships set up. We have bundled these into a trait 
and an interface, which you must add to any models that represent users in your database.

```php
use Lunar\Base\Traits\LunarUser;
use Lunar\Base\LunarUser as LunarUserInterface;
// ...

class User extends Authenticatable implements LunarUserInterface
{
    use LunarUser;
    // ...
}
```

### Publish Configuration
Before you run the Lunar installer command, you may wish to customise some of the set-up.


```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lunar
```

## Register the admin panel

The admin panel needs registering in your app service provider before you can use it.

```php
use Lunar\Admin\Support\Facades\LunarPanel;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        LunarPanel::register();
    }
```

## Run the Artisan Installer

```sh
php artisan lunar:install
```

This will take you through a set of questions to configure your Lunar install. The process includes...

- Creating a default admin user (if required)
- Seeding initial data
- Inviting you to star our repo on GitHub ‚≠ê

You should now be able to access the panel at `https://<yoursite>/lunar`.

## Advanced Installation Options

### Telemetry insights

Lunar will phone home to send anonymous usage insights, the data we capture does not identify your store in any way, it
exists to help us gain an understanding of how Lunar is used. You can easily opt out of this by adding the following to
your service provider's boot method:

```php
\Lunar\Facades\Telemetry::optOut();
```

### Table Prefix

Lunar uses table prefixes to avoid conflicts with your app's tables. You can change this in the [configuration](/core/configuration.html).

### User ID Field Type

Lunar assumes your User ID field is a "BIGINT". If you are using an "INT" or "UUID", you will want to update the configuration in `config/lunar/database.php` to set the correct field type before running the migrations.

### Publish Migrations

You can optionally publish Lunar's migrations so they're added to your Laravel app.

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lunar.migrations
```
