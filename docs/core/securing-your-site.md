# Securing Your Site

## Overview

When you move to production, you will want to make sure you have taken all the steps possible to secure your site and the data that powers it. Lunar takes this very seriously and always do our best to follow industry practices.

## Securing search

Depending on which search driver you are using will depend on how you lock down the data that Lunar indexes in a production environment. To provide a rich search experience in the hub. We currently index the following models, which may contain sensitive information.

### What is sensitive information?

We classify sensitive information as data that contains information about your customers or orders, whether identifiable or not. Information such as addresses, emails, names is likely to be indexed for use in the hub.

### Lunar's indexes

Index names are relative to the `SCOUT_PREFIX` env variable.

|Model|Index|Contains Sensitive Information|
|:-|:-|:-|
`\Lunar\Models\Product`|`products`|❌|
`\Lunar\Models\Collection`|`collections`|❌|
`\Lunar\Models\ProductOption`|`product_options`|❌|
`\Lunar\Models\Customer`|`customers`|✅|
`\Lunar\Models\Order`|`orders`|✅|


## Securing Meilisearch

In a production environment, you must set an API key to allow access to the search endpoints that Meilisearch provides. It is recommended to have two API keys, one to perform admin tasks such as indexing documents (read/write) and one solely for reading.
