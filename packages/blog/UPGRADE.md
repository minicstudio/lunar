## ⬆️ From 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 (Current)

#### 🐞 Bug Fixes & Improvements

- ServiceProvider refactored for better code organization
- Console command structure improved
- Seeder autoload configuration in composer.json fixed
- Better separation of concerns with dedicated private methods
- URL generator configuration consolidated into main blog config

#### 🔧 Changes

**ServiceProvider Structure:**

```php
// Old structure: Everything in boot()
// New structure: Organized private methods
$this->loadPackageAssets();
$this->publishAssets();
$this->registerObservers();
$this->registerRelations();
$this->registerMorphMap();
$this->registerModelManifest();
$this->registerConsoleCommands();
```

**Autoload Configuration:**
The `composer.json` now includes the seeder autoload path:

```json
"Lunar\\Blog\\Database\\Seeders\\": "database/seeders"
```

**URL Generator Configuration:**

The URL generator configuration has been consolidated:

```php
// config/lunar/blog.php
return [
    'enabled' => env('BLOG_ENABLED', false),
    
    'urlGenerator' => \Lunar\Blog\Generators\UrlGenerator::class,
];
```

**Model Trait Updates:**

BlogPost and BlogCategory now use trait composition with `insteadof`:

```php
use HasUrls, BlogHasUrls {
    BlogHasUrls::bootHasUrls insteadof HasUrls;
}
```

This allows:
- Inheriting all URL relationship methods from Core `HasUrls` trait
- Using Blog-specific `bootHasUrls()` from Blog `HasUrls` trait
- No code duplication in model definitions

**Console Command:**
The `RunLunarBlogSeederCommand` now correctly instantiates the seeder class directly.

#### 💻 Required Actions

After upgrading, run:

```bash
# Publish only the main blog config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lunar.blog.config"

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed blog data
php artisan lunar:seed-blog
```

The separate URL configuration publishing is no longer needed as it's part of the main config.
